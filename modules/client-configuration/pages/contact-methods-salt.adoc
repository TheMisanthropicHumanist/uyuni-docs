= Salt Contact Method

The Salt contact method is the default choice and recommended unless there are specific needs.
For more information about Salt in general, see xref:salt:salt-overview.adoc[].

The Salt Contact Method is the best scaling method.
All new {productname} features are supported and it has the widest variety of supported operating systems.
All new operating systems are always supported with this contact method.

Software updates are generally pushed from the server to the client.
Connections are initiated from the client.
This means you must open ports on the server, not on clients.
The Salt clients are also known as Salt minions.
{productname} Server (also known as Salt Server) installs a small daemon on every client.

If you need to use Salt clients in a disconnected setup you can configure Push via Salt SSH as a contact method.
With this contact method, clients can be located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ.
For more information about Push via Salt SSH, see xref:client-configuration:contact-methods-saltssh.adoc[].
