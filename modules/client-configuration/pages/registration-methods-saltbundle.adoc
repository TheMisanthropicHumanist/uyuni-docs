= Client Registration with Salt Bundle

Since end of 2021, the registration method with the so-called Salt bundle is available.
The Salt bundle is provided as the [package]``venv-salt-minion`` that consists of Salt and all the packages the version of Salt depends on.
Using the Salt bundle it is no longer needed that the client provides the required Python version and [package]``python-xml`` package.

If you bootstrap new clients, registration with the Salt bundle is the
default method.  You can switch existing clients to the Salt bundle
method.  If you switch the [package]``salt-minion`` package and its
Python version will stay installed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
At the moment (2021), the Salt bundle does not support the Salt SSH contact method.
Stay with [package]``salt-minion`` package if you use Salt SSH.
